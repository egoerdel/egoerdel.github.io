  profile: 
    - "As an environmental geoscientist, I am passionate about sustainability and educating others on the importance of being better stewards of our natural resources. Seeking an environmental career in environmental research, field testing with site collection and assessment, regulatory compliance and/or data management. Working outdoors, collecting and analyzing data, and monitoring compliance are my greatest areas of interest."
    - "My experience is in solar data analysis specifically in community solar for low income communities. I have utilized my experience in architecting and implementing Identity Management solutions for data integration to analyze data for project identification and to research relevant foundations and potential funding. My major started in computer science and I have served full-time with a non-profit solar energy initiative and worked for three technology companies (two in web design and another in corporate security and data management)."
    - "Now I am now bridging the gap between my experience and my degree in Environmental Geoscience from Texas A&M."
